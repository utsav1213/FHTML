            <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/6880208.Magnus_Carlsen">
                <p>“Self-confidence is very important. If you don’t think you can win, you will take cowardly decisions in the crucial moments, out of sheer respect for your opponent. You see the opportunity but also greater limitations than you should. I have always believed in what I do on the chessboard, even when I had no objective reason to. It is better to overestimate your prospects than underestimate them.”.</p>
